### The RequestBoard

The RequestBoard is another part of each ChoreGroup menu, and is where members can create requests for other members to accept. Each requested chore has a point value attached to them (default is 100pts) and these points are awarded to whoever accepts, and completes the chore.

### The RewardBoard

The RewardBoard is the final part of the menu, and is where users can use their points to claim rewards! The rewards can be set by other members of the group, and are meant to incentivize other group members into completing their chores.
